# Postinference queries

## Cube closure queries
These update operations check the components of the data structure definition of the data set for declared attachment levels. For each of the possible attachments levels it looks for occurrences of that component to be pushed down to the corresponding observations. They are slightly modified form the original in irder to take contexts into account and write updates into the corresponding graphs.
